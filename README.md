# shortcut_keys

**Problem:**

Whenever we search for something we have to use the mouse to click a particular web link and moving your hand to the mouse

1. Wastes time
2. Breaks workflow thinking

### Solution
Decreasing the time it takes to open an weblink by hotlinking all the weblinks with a shortcut toggle . This essentially allows the developers to open any weblink on the chrome browser without their hands leaving the keyboard.
